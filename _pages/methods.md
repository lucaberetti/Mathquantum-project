This project would work through a collaboration between statistics, computational biology, and quantum computing. 
First, data on the distribution and optimal ranges of oak species considered ***hypothetically*** would have to be found.
Then, quantum algorithms such as [this one](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.03804) can be applied. 
The results can then be applied to create a species distribution model.

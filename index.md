As climate change takes more of a toll on our planet, the need for ecological restoration has increased. This is why I am focusing on using quantum computing to predict weather for use in species distribution models. **Specifically for oak conservation** 

Look here for a better explanation of what ecological restoration is. [here](https://ser-rrc.org/what-is-ecological-restoration/).

Complex numbers can also be represented in polar form as seen below

To understand how the polar form is derived, check out this video.

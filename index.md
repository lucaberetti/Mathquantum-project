As climate change takes more of a toll on our planet, the need for ecological restoration has increased. This is why I am focusing on using quantum computing to predict weather for use in species distribution models. 
**If this were to be implemented, I would use it specifically for oak conservation** 

Look here for a better explanation of what ecological restoration is. [here](https://ser-rrc.org/what-is-ecological-restoration/). 

The video linked below can explain quantum computing in more detail. *This video is one of my personal favorites*
